# Python for Data Analysis – Complete Practice & Exercise

This repository contains my complete learning and hands-on practice work from a full Python Data Analytics course.  
It covers Python fundamentals, NumPy, Pandas, and Data Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

The focus of this repository is practical implementation for a **Data Analyst role**, not theoretical programming.

# 🧠 Technical Skills Implemented

## 1️⃣ Python Fundamentals
- Variables & Data Types  
- Arithmetic & Logical Operators  
- Conditional Statements (if / elif / else)  
- Loops (for, while)  
- Functions  
- Basic Exception Handling  
- Jupyter Notebook workflow  

---

## 2️⃣ NumPy – Numerical Computing
- Creating NumPy arrays  
- Indexing & slicing  
- Array aggregations (mean, sum, etc.)  
- Understanding how Pandas leverages NumPy internally  

---

## 3️⃣ Pandas – Core Data Analysis (Primary Focus)

- Reading CSV & Excel files  
- DataFrame operations  
- Filtering & Sorting  
- `groupby()` for segmentation analysis  
- `pivot_table()` for multi-dimensional summaries  
- Merge & Join operations  
- Handling Missing Values  
- Data Cleaning & Transformation  
- Using `explode()` to normalize multi-skill columns  

This section represents the core technical skills required for a Junior Data Analyst position.

## 4️⃣ Data Visualization

Visualizations were built using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** with focus on clarity and business readability.

Charts created include:

- Line Charts  
- Bar Charts  
- Histograms  
- Count Plots  
- Heatmaps  
- Trend Visualizations  

Emphasis: Clear, insight-driven visual storytelling.

# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Performed end-to-end data analysis including:

- Data loading & inspection  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Salary analysis by job role & experience  
- Skill demand frequency analysis  
- Job distribution by location  
- Remote vs On-site job comparison  
- Trend analysis over time  
- Data visualization & insight extraction

## 📌 Dataset Used

The primary dataset used for analysis in this repository:

**Data Jobs Dataset**  
Source: https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs  

This dataset includes job postings related to data roles and contains information such as:
- Job titles
- Salary information
- Location
- Required skills
- Company information

It was used to perform real-world Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), salary analysis, skill demand analysis, and data cleaning tasks.
